        <p class="textos">If ever there was an artist who doesn’t need an introduction, it has to be the man known to
            music lovers the world over simply as El Maestro. Throughout his rise to become both a foundation and a
            founding father of the underground house scene, the name Hernán Cattáneo has become synonymous with
            dedication, passion and an unwavering commitment to championing a unique quality of music that is hard to
            define, but instantly recognisable as his signature sound.

            His effortless ability to clock up more than 30 years of DJing, 11 albums, 30 singles and 50 remixes is the
            legacy of a uniquely powerful personal touch, which ensured that Hernán stood out from the start. During his
            first DJ residency at Buenos Aires’ legendary Clubland, it was Hernán’s winning combination of humble
            professionalism, primal passion for the music and deep­rooted dedication to the dancefloor­lovers which
            enabled him to make his mark as a warm­up DJ for some of the biggest names in dance music. And it was his
            friendships with those names ­ among them Paul Oakenfold, John Digweed and Sasha ­ that set him on the path
            to superstardom. Within just a few short years of embarking on an international DJ career, Hernán became the
            first ever South American resident for global brand Cream; won residencies at Cream in Ibiza and Liverpool
            and Pacha in Buenos Aires and Ibiza; and went on to grace the DJ Mag Top 100 poll ten years in a row.

            The quality of his selection and production skills were soon being called on by the biggest house labels,
            including Bedrock, Perfecto, Renaissance and Balance. As his global career grew, so too did his legions of
            fans, and word spread worldwide about the man whose legendary all­night sets had the power to set your feet
            on fire and make your soul sing. Long­since established as a hot ticket in any town, Hernán’s legendary
            all­night sets have seen him conquer every corner of the globe. From Warung Brazil, Yellow in Tokyo and LA’s
            Avalon to Stereo Montreal, Burning Man and London’s Ministry of Sound, there is scarcely a club, festival or
            dancefloor on the planet that hasn’t been transported on a masterful music journey lasting long after the
            ebb of the final beat.

            But beyond his own achievements and accolades, there are much deeper motivations moving the man who has
            become one of Argentina’s most treasured musical exports. As one of the rarified few artists to reach the
            very top, he works tirelessly to give his all back to the scene that supported him on his way up. Rightly
            renowned for his consistent championing of up and coming artists and labels, he has become as applauded for
            spotlighting the talent of the next generation as for his own skills. Through his DJ sets, his own Sudbeat
            label and his world­famous weekly Resident radio show, he is constantly connecting a global community, and
            providing an essential platform which enables new stars to shine. And while his own star continues to soar,
            perhaps Hernan’s greatest passion lies in empowering others to enjoy the best house music in the world, and
            shaping the future of that music for generations to come..</p>
